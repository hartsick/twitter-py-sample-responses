Twitter API Sample Responses
=========================================
*Mock objects for Python.*

I found the lack of documentation on different responses to be frustrating when first working with the Twitter Streaming API, so I started collecting responses for easy reference in building my [bots](http://52bots.tumblr.com).

Thought this may be a common frustration, especially for newbies like myself, so decided to open these up as a reference.

I'll update only as I encounter the need for new fixtures, so if there's other sample data you think would be useful for others (or if you spot any errors), please submit a PR.
