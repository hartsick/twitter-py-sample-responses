*Sample responses in Python from the Twitter APIs*
Intended to be used as mock objects for tests.
=========================================

I found the lack of documentation on different responses to be frustrating when first working with the Twitter Streaming API, so I started collecting responses for easy reference to help build my bots.

I'll update only as I encounter the need for new fixtures, so if there's other sample data you have and think would be useful for others, please submit a PR.
